        <p>For the past 3 years, the state has tread water in terms of closing the degree gap. A degree gap is bad for the economy, our citizenry, and the state as a whole.</p>

        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <h3>This report presents revised <em>data on</em> what California’s degree gap will look like in 2025.</h3>
        <p>It also explores the growth in California bachelor’s degrees over a ten year period, examining the growth and decline of specific majors to gain an understanding as to how various courses of study have shifted over a ten year period, and suggesting what we might expect the next ten years to look like. In understanding the top majors, we also take a look at the producers of different degrees to gain some understanding as to the state’s investment in producing high demand majors. Finally, the report looks at how the top majors vary by race to get a sense of the extent to which the top majors are equitably distributed.</p>

        <p>In 2012, California Competes declared that California will face a gap of 2.3 million college credentials by 2025, a number that has gained wide currency. Much has changed in the last three years—the economy, the size and composition of the state’s population, and the relative importance of higher education for getting a good job—prompting us to revisit the degree gap.</p>

        <h2>Bachelor's Degrees Overview</h2>
        <h3 class="font-4x center">Bachelor's Degrees</h3>
        <p class="font-1_5x tight-center justify">Between 2004 and 2013, the number of bachelor’s degrees awarded per year by California-based colleges and universities overall has grown by a little more than a quarter, from a total of 141,873, to 180,592. While counting the total number of bachelor’s degrees is important, a lot can happen underneath those totals.</p>

        <h2>What fields have these degrees been in?</h2>
        <h3>What?</h3>
        <p class="highlight">17% of all BA’s were in business and marketing in 2013 while <em>only 2% of all BA’s were in computer science.</em> Health professions nearly tripled, bringing it into the top 10.</p>
        <p>If you look at the top ten majors, you’ll notice that with the exception of health professions, which nearly tripled in the last ten years, all of the majors were listed in the top ten in 2004. Surprisingly, computer science has slipped from 8th place to tied for last. The data show that both the producers and the emphasis within the computer science field have changed significantly over the last ten years. UC has solidified its hold on the computer science major while CSU produced many more computer information systems (CONFIRM) majors. For-Profit institutions have staked a claim in computer software and media applications major and are the only institutions offering the major computer systems analysis.</p>

        <h2>Who?</h2>
        <p class="highlight">With 4%, African Americans receive the fewest number of BAs. Latinos and Asians receive degrees in roughly even numbers. The dominate receiver of BAs in California is still whites.</p>
        <p>Business and marketing dominated across all races. White and Asians are more likely to major in engineering than are blacks and latinos. By contrast Blacks and Latinos are much more likely to major in law enforcement and related fields than Whites and Asians.</p>

      <section id="slide-7-who-is-the-producer" class="slide shadow bachelors-degrees">
        <h2>Where?</h2>
        <p>The dominant producers of degrees is largely unchanged, with the 23-campus California State University (CSU) system awarding nearly half of the bachelor’s degrees (about 45 percent), and the nine undergraduate campuses of the University of California carrying just over a fourth of the load. The private nonprofit sector confers about a fifth of the bachelor’s degrees produced in California, while for-profit institutions were responsible for about seven percent. With roughly 70 percent of bachelor’s degrees being produced by California’s public sector, the state relies less on non-public providers than many other states. This is particularly true for New England and the mid-east in general, where on average the split between public and private is 50:50.</p>
