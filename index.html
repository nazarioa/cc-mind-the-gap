        <h3>This report presents <em>revised data</em> on what California’s degree gap will look like in 2025.</h3>
        <hr>
        <p>In 2012, California Competes declared that California will face a gap of 2.3 million college credentials by 2025. Much has changed in the last three years—the economy, the size and composition of the state’s population, and the perceived importance of higher education for getting a good job—prompting us to revisit the state’s progress in closing degree gap.</p>

        <hr>
        <p class="font-1_5x tight-center justify">Between 2004 and 2013, the number of bachelor’s degrees awarded per year by California-based colleges and universities overall has grown by a little more than a quarter, from a total of 141,900, to 180,600. While counting the total number of bachelor’s degrees is important, a lot can happen underneath these totals.</p>

        <h3>What?</h3>
        <p class="highlight">17% of all BA’s were in business and marketing in 2013 while <em>only 2% of all BA’s were in computer science.</em> Health professions nearly tripled, bringing it into the top 10.</p>
        <p>If you look at the top ten majors, you’ll notice that with the exception of health professions, which nearly tripled in the last ten years, all of the majors were listed in the top ten in 2004. Surprisingly, computer science has slipped from 8th place to tied for last. The data show that both the producers and the emphasis within the computer science field have changed significantly over the last ten years. UC has solidified its hold on the computer science major while CSU produced many more computer information systems (CONFIRM) majors. For-Profit institutions have staked a claim in computer software and media applications major and are the only institutions offering the major computer systems analysis.</p>

        <h2>Where?<span class="toggle">&nbsp;</span></h2>
        <p>The dominant producers of degrees is largely unchanged, with the 23-campus California State University (CSU) system awarding nearly half of the bachelor’s degrees (about 45 percent), and the nine undergraduate campuses of the University of California carrying just over a fourth of the load. The private nonprofit sector confers about a fifth of the bachelor’s degrees produced in California, while for-profit institutions were responsible for about seven percent. With roughly 70 percent of bachelor’s degrees being produced by California’s public sector, the state relies less on non-public providers than many other states. This is particularly true for New England and the mid-east in general, where on average the split between public and private is 50:50.</p>

        <h3>Policy Recommendations</h3>
        <hr>
        <p class="highlight">Our analysis of the looming degree attainment gap and our examination of trends in both majors and producers of degrees suggest <em>several potential policy recommendations.</em></p>
        <p class="font-1_5x tight-center justify">The objectives of our recommendations are two-fold. First, they are intended broadly to increase the number of students obtaining degrees to meet the state’s educational, workforce, and civic needs, with special attention given to students who are traditionally underrepresented but increasingly de ning the landscape of our colleges. These recommendations are also intended to ensure that, as the state produces more degrees, those degrees more closely align with regional labor market needs. In short, our recommendations are attentive to balancing the demands of a broad, statewide public agenda with a desire to promote access and equity for students.</p>

        <h3>Policy Recommendations</h3>
        <hr>
        <p class="highlight">Our analysis of the looming degree attainment gap and our examination of trends in both majors and producers of degrees suggest <em>several potential policy recommendations.</em></p>
        <p>Re ecting the consensus among policy researchers, our recommendations fall under four categories that reinforce several of the broad priorities articulated in the PPIC report “Will California Run Out of College Graduates?” including increasing access to four year colleges, improving and accelerating pathways that promote degree completion, reforming governance to improve college productivity, and making wise and targeted state investments in higher education. In the coming months, California Competes will develop full policy briefs on the recommendations proposed.</p>
        <div>
          <h2>To increase access to four year colleges the state should:</h2>
          <dl>
            <!-- step 1 -->
            <dt><span class="step">1</span>Develope a sysetm<span>for reaching out to adult learners.</span></dt>
            <dd>
              <p class="highlight">The number of people who must now be brought into higher education to close our 2025 attainment gap requires California to look beyond traditional age students and more aggressively recruit adult learners to return to college, particularly those with some college and partial credit.</p>
              <p>We propose that California create a mechanism, either through a higher education coordinating entity or through one of the system of ces, to identify older adults interested in completing a degree or credential, or upgrading their skills. This would include developing a robust system of prior learning assessment, since research shows that adults with credits from prior learning are 2.5 times more likely to complete a degree. To maintain a commitment to equity, this system might include collaborations with other state agencies, such as Veterans Affairs or the Department of Parole, to help identify learners with educational needs. The recently developed community college Growth Funding Formula could be effectively utilized to conduct additional outreach to those with some college who need to complete a degree. The state might also consider concomitant changes in our nancial aid policies—such a providing full tuition to those needing 18 credits or less complete their degrees — to facilitate more rapid degree attainment. To improve and accelerate pathways that promote degree completion the state should:</p>
            </dd>

            <!-- step 2 -->
            <dt><span class="step">2</span>Provide funding<span>to pilot test more 3 year bachelor degrees.</span></dt>
            <dd>
              <p class="highlight">Largely in response to high college costs, there is an emerging literature on how to graduate college students in three years rather than four.</p>
              <p>These proposals vary in nature, with some arguing this should be a new standard in higher education that would prompt and promote curricular innovation, while others see it as a more targeted approach that would apply to speci c majors. Here in California, three year degrees have been implemented by Cal State Monterey Bay, in partnership with Hartnell Community College, to deliver a computer science degree in three years. The program, which focuses enrollment on Latino students, won an Award for Innovation in Higher Education in 2015. This policy would direct CSUs and UCs to design programs, in partnership with their local two year institutions, to identify majors and develop appropriate curricula. The state should provide  nancial support to pilot test these new curricula coupled with mentoring and professional development for those starting new programs. The state might also consider providing bonuses to those institutions that effectively graduate students and also meet a broader set of equity goals by graduating low income and/or traditionally underrepresented students.</p>

        <p class="highlight">It would take increases <em>of just under 10% per year, every year,</em> compounding, to close the 2.4 million gap by 2025.</p>
        <p>If all trends continue California is slated to produce roughly 9,523,300 degrees by 2025. In order to remain competitive it will need to produce 11,920,000, meaning that California is now facing a degree gap of 2.4 million in 2025. As a state we now have three fewer years for addressing the degree gap. It is highly unlikely that the state can catch up since the students who will theoretically graduate from college in 2025 are already in middle school.</p>
