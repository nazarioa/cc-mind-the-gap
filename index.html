        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <h3>This report presents <em>revised data</em> on what California's degree gap will look like in 2025.</h3>
        <hr>
        <p>In 2012, California Competes declared that California will face a gap of 2.3 million college credentials by 2025. Much has changed in the last three years—the economy, the size and composition of the state's population, and the perceived importance of higher education for getting a good job—prompting us to revisit the state's progress in closing the degree gap. Explore how the gap changes below.</p>

        </div>
        <p class="highlight">In order to close the degree attainment gap, <em>we need to increase the number of degrees by roughly 10% per year,</em> every year for the next 10 years.</p>
        <ul>
          <li>In the chart to the right, the blue shows the number of degrees the state is projected to produce (i.e. 298,400 in 2025).</li>
          <li>The green depicts the number of degrees produced each year, if we increased production by 10% each year (i.e. 796,800 in 2025).</li>
          <li>The red shows how many degrees would be added in total by the 10% increases. In 2016, after the  rst 10% increase, the state would add 41,080 degrees but by 2025, 2.4 million degrees would be added, closing the degree gap.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Unfortunately this is an unlikely situation. The state has less than a decade to make massive changes and the students who will theoretically graduate from college in 2025 are already in middle school.</p>

        <p class="font-150x tight-center justify">Between 2004 and 2013, the number of bachelor's degrees awarded per year by California-based colleges and universities overall has grown by a little more than a quarter, from a total of 141,900, to 180,600.

        <p class="highlight font-200x">Business and marketing remained the most popular choice for a bachelor's degree while, surprisingly, <em>only 2% of graduates majored in computer and information sciences.</em></p>
        <p>If you look at the top ten majors, you'll notice that with the exception of health professions, which nearly tripled in the last ten years, all of the majors were listed in the top ten in 2004. Surprisingly, computer and information sciences has slipped from 8th place to tied for last. The data show that both the producers and the emphasis within the computer and information sciences field have changed significantly over the last ten years. UC now dominates the computer science sub-major while CSU produces almost 50% fewer computer science degrees than it did in 2004. For-profit institutions have staked a claim in the computer in computer software and media applications major and are the only institutions offering the major computer systems analysis.</p>

        <h3 class="center">Policy Recommendations</h3>
        <hr>
        <p class="highlight center">Our analysis of the looming degree attainment gap and our examination of trends in both the majors and producers of degrees suggest <em>several potential policy recommendations.</em></p>
        <p class="font-120x tight-center justify">The objectives of our recommendations are three-fold. First, they are intended broadly to increase the number of students obtaining degrees. Second, these recommendations are meant to ensure that, as California produces more degrees, those degrees more closely align with the state's educational, workforce, and civic needs—both regionally and statewide. Third, our recommendations compel the state to pay special attention to students who are traditionally underrepresented but increasingly defining the landscape of our colleges and communities. In short, our recommendations seek to balance the demands of a broad, statewide public agenda for higher education with a desire to promote increased access and greater equity for students, without which the state's prospects for economic vitality and social cohesion will be diminished.</p>

            <dt class="inactive"><span class="step">1</span>Develop a system<span class="subheading">for reaching out to adult learners.</span></dt>
            <dd class="hidden">
              <p class="highlight">The number of people now needed to close the attainment gap by 2025 requires California to expand its definition of a traditional student and more aggressively recruit adult learners, particularly those with some college and partial credit, to complete college.</p>
              <p>We propose that California create a centralized mechanism, preferably through a higher education coordinating entity, to identify older adults interested in completing a degree or credential or upgrading their skills. This would necessitate developing a robust system for assessing prior learning, since research shows that adults with partial college credits are 2.5 times more likely to complete a degree.  It would also require that the state itself consider carefully how to provide for targeted enrollment growth to accommodate an increased number of degree seekers.</p>
              <p>To maintain a commitment to equity, this system might include collaborations with other state agencies, such as Department of Veterans Affairs or the Division of Parole through the California Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation, to help target adults with the most unmet need for higher education. The recently developed community college <a href="http://californiacompetes.org/news_and_events/where-access-to-comm-colleges-is-needed-most/">Growth Funding Formula</a> could be effectively utilized to conduct additional outreach to those with some college who need to complete a degree. California might also consider concomitant changes in financial aid policies—such a providing full tuition to financially needy adult students with 18 credits or fewer to complete their degrees—to facilitate more rapid degree attainment. </p>

            <dd class="hidden">
              <p class="highlight">Largely in response to high college costs, there is an emerging literature on how to graduate college students in three years rather than four.</p>
              <p>These proposals vary in nature, with some arguing that three-year degrees should be a new standard in higher education, and others advocating it as a more targeted approach for specific majors. Here in California, three-year degrees have been implemented by CSU Monterey Bay, in partnership with Hartnell Community College, to deliver a computer science degree. The program, which prioritizes enrollment among Latino students, won an <a href="http://www.dof.ca.gov/innovationawards/">Award for Innovation in Higher Education</a> in 2015. A pilot test promoting three-year degrees would direct CSUs and UCs to design programs, potentially in partnership with their local two-year institutions, to identify majors and develop appropriate curricula. The state should provide financial support to help faculty and colleges revamp curricula and course scheduling practices, and couple that support with mentoring and professional development resources for those starting new programs. The state might also consider providing bonuses to those institutions that effectively graduate students in three years and meet a broader set of equity goals by graduating low- income and traditionally underrepresented students.</p>

              <p class="highlight">Current events (such as the debate regarding the <a href="http://www.dailycal.org/2014/11/18/breaking-uc-tuition-increase-policy/">UC tuition increase</a> and California's short-lived <a href="http://www.dof.ca.gov/innovationawards/">innovation prize</a>) continue to make the case for a statewide coordinating entity—one that can articulate and uphold a broad public agenda for higher education, create a mechanism for ensuring that its segments are accountable to that agenda and spur innovation to close the degree attainment gap.  </p>
              <p>As discussed in California Competes' report "<a href="http://californiacompetes.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/Charting-a-Course1.pdf">Charting a Course</a>," there are any number of organizational structures that could be adopted to provide this kind of longer-term planning and oversight, while increasing the coordination between higher education systems and institutions. The main responsibility of that entity would be to view higher education through a cohesive statewide lens rather than a siloed, segmental perspective by:</p>
              <ul>
                <li>Projecting state needs for an education workforce;</li>
                <li>Identifying gaps between expected graduates and state needs;</li>
                <li>Developing cost-effective strategies for helping to close the gap and allocating higher education resources wisely, both within and amongst the educational segments; and</li>
                <li>Developing proposals for increased system and institutional accountability.</li>
              </ul>
              <p>Finally, essential to accomplishing any of these goals is creating a comprehensive, student-level data system (inclusive of P-12 and labor market data) to provide accurate information on student progress, institutional outcomes, and especially  labor market information to better inform state investments in various academic programs.</p>

              <p class="highlight">Significant research has been conducted to show that students who enroll full time have greater retention and are more likely to persist and complete college than those who attend part time.</p>
              <p>Several states, including Illinois, Indiana, and Minnesota, have created programs that promote full-time enrollment for students. Policies such as flat-rate tuition for a minimum number of credits, while common in other states, are not consistently deployed in California.  , There are other strategies, such as "intrusive advising" or learning communities, that could be coupled with financial incentives and other supports to encourage degree completion. Incentives and supports could include aid to cover non-tuition related expenses (i.e., food, books, housing) to reduce the likelihood of students having to work part time, free and reliable transportation, incentive grants, and daycare for children and/or siblings. California should examine whether particular institutions or courses of study might lend themselves to such an approach.</p>

In the coming months, California Competes will develop full policy briefs on the recommendations proposed below.</p>
